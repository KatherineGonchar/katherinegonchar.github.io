            Once a player starts the main game, they are asked increasingly difficult general knowledge questions.
            Each features four possible answers, to which the player must give the correct answer. Doing
            so wins them a certain amount of money, with tackling more difficult questions increasing their prize fund.
            <br>
            During their game, the player has a set of lifelines that they may use only once to help them with a
            question, as well as two "safety nets" â€“ if a contestant gets a question wrong, but had reached a designated
            cash value during their game, they will leave with that amount as their prize.
